Create a git repository, and put a server.js file in its root.
git remote add joyent ssh://node@72.2.126.230/repo
git push joyent master
Optionally:
ssh node@72.2.126.230
In a few minutes the nameservers will propagate your subdomain record and you will be able to access your server at emerleite.no.de. Until then use 72.2.126.230.
